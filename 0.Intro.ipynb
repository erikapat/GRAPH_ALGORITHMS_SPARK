The advantage over other machine learning methods is that node attribute inference gives you the ability to bring in context and neighbourhood information into your predictions. For example, in an online social network we might be interested in predicting the music preferences of a user’s friendship network\n",

There are many applications for community detection, [1]. One example is segmentation of users of a social network into communities based on their hobbies, without having to explicitly ask each user if they are interested in that topic. Instead answers to topical questions, for example, ‘Do you like fiction or nonfiction?’, are answered by the algorithm using the data gathered from the people the individual frequently interacts with. Such segmentation can be used to deliver targeted ads based on common traits of community members.\n",

As an example, consider the representation of a chemical compound as a graph; in this case, nodes are atoms and edges are bonds between atoms. Given a set of chemical compounds each represented as a graph, we want to predict whether a compound is cancer-hindering or not. This is a graph classification problem, [2].\n",
